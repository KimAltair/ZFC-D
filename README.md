# ZFC-D

# The Conflict Between Non-definable Reals and the Axiom of Choice in ZFC

## Abstract
We examine the consequences of applying the Axiom of Choice (AC) within
ZFC to the set D := R \ C, where C denotes the set of computable real numbers.
We argue that any choice function defined on D inevitably introduces a structure in
which its elements become effectively referable or indexable, thereby contradicting
the definition of D as unnameable and unindexable. This leads to a logical inconsis-
tency, suggesting that AC is incompatible with the existence of D. To resolve this
conflict, we propose a modified axiomatic system, ZFC D/AC, in which the Axiom
of Choice is explicitly restricted from applying to sets composed of non-definable
real numbers. This result prompts broader meta-mathematical reflection on the in-
terplay between definability, choice, and the foundational assumptions underlying
mathematical existence.
